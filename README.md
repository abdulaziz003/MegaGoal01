This course for teaching EFL using the [McGrawHill](https://www.mheducation.com/) book MegaGoal 3. This book is a dynamic American English series for international communication that takes students from absolute beginning to high-intermediate level. It is specifically designed for teenagers and young adults. With eye-catching art and high-interest topics, MegaGoal is easy and enjoyable to teach and to learn from..

### My Goal
